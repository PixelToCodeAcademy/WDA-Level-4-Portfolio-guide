### Example Portfolio Evidence

#### Context
**Outline:** I work for Pixel To Code, a web development company that specialises in creating bespoke websites. Pixel To Code has a team of 20 developers, 5 designers, and 3 project managers. We work with a diverse range of clients, from small businesses to large corporations, providing services such as website development, mobile app development, and digital marketing solutions. My role within the company is as a web developer, where I focus on front-end development, ensuring the creation of responsive and interactive user interfaces.

For this project, we partnered with GreenEarth Landscaping Solutions, a company based in San Francisco, CA, founded in 2010. GreenEarth Landscaping Solutions offers a range of services including landscape design, maintenance, and sustainable solutions. Their mission is to transform outdoor spaces into beautiful, sustainable environments that enhance the quality of life for their clients and contribute to a greener planet.

GreenEarth's Marketing Director, John Doe, contacted Pixel To Code to help them enhance their online presence and client engagement through a modern and user-friendly website. This project involved a complete redesign of their existing site, focusing on improving accessibility, visual appeal, and functionality.

**Objectives:** The primary goal was to redesign GreenEarth’s website to enhance user experience, improve online presence, and increase client engagement. Specific objectives included:

1. **Enhance Online Presence:** Improve brand visibility through a modern, user-friendly website that is optimised for search engines (SEO).
2. **Showcase Services:** Clearly present the range of services offered, including landscape design, maintenance, and sustainable solutions.
3. **Client Engagement:** Provide an easy way for clients to request quotes, schedule consultations, and contact GreenEarth.
4. **Content Management:** Implement a content management system (CMS) that allows GreenEarth to easily update services, blog posts, and client testimonials.

**Background:** The project was initiated when GreenEarth’s Marketing Director, John Doe, reached out to Pixel To Code. He outlined their requirements and provided us with their current branding guidelines, including logos, colour palettes, and typography standards.

The existing GreenEarth website was outdated and not mobile-friendly, which hindered their ability to attract new clients and adequately showcase their services. They needed a website that would be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and capable of highlighting their commitment to sustainability. The new website was also required to be SEO-friendly to improve their search engine rankings and attract more organic traffic.

The project was scheduled to run from 1 August 2024 to 1 November 2024, with a budget of £8,000-£12,000. The team involved in this project included John Doe as the Project Manager, Jane Smith as the UI/UX Designer, and myself as the Developer. Our approach was to use Agile methodology to ensure iterative development and incorporate client feedback at every stage. This collaboration aimed to deliver a website that not only met but exceeded GreenEarth’s expectations.

#### Planning
**Timescales & Cost:** The project was structured with a three-month timeline, starting from 1 August 2024 to 1 November 2024. This included initial planning, design, development, testing, and deployment phases. The allocated budget for the project was between £8,000 and £12,000. This budget covered design, development, testing, deployment, and initial maintenance and support post-launch.

**Software Methodology Approach:** (Supports K5)

**Comparison of Agile and Waterfall Methodologies:**

We compared Agile and Waterfall methodologies before deciding on the best approach for this project. The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one. It’s often used when project requirements are well understood and unlikely to change. This method requires extensive documentation and typically has less room for flexibility once the project is underway.

In contrast, Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that allows for flexibility and continuous improvement. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, use short development cycles called sprints. This allows teams to deliver smaller, functional segments of the project regularly and adapt to changes quickly based on client feedback.

**Why Agile was Chosen for This Project:**

We adopted the Agile methodology for this project. Agile allowed us to work in iterative cycles, known as sprints, which enabled continuous feedback from GreenEarth and adjustments to be made throughout the project lifecycle. This approach ensured that the final product was closely aligned with GreenEarth's requirements and expectations. Each sprint lasted two weeks, and at the end of each sprint, we conducted a review meeting with the client to showcase progress and gather feedback.

- **Flexibility:** Agile provided the flexibility needed to incorporate changes based on GreenEarth’s feedback. This was particularly important as the project requirements evolved over time.
- **Client Involvement:** Regular sprint reviews allowed GreenEarth to be actively involved in the development process, ensuring their vision was accurately implemented.
- **Early Detection of Issues:** Agile's iterative nature helped us identify and resolve issues early, reducing the risk of major problems later in the project.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Each sprint allowed us to refine our processes and improve the project incrementally, leading to a higher quality final product.

**Example of our sprint review process:**

1. **Sprint Planning:** At the start of each sprint, we held a planning meeting to outline tasks and set goals for the upcoming two weeks.
2. **Daily Stand-ups:** Conducted daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, obstacles, and next steps.
3. **Development and Testing:** Focused on developing and testing specific features or components during the sprint.
4. **Sprint Review:** At the end of each sprint, we held a review meeting with GreenEarth to demonstrate the completed work. This allowed for immediate feedback and ensured alignment with their expectations.
5. **Sprint Retrospective:** Held a retrospective meeting to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how to apply lessons learned in the next sprint.

This Agile approach facilitated a collaborative environment where the final product evolved through continuous client feedback and iterative development, ensuring that GreenEarth's new website met their needs effectively.

#### Design

**Design Guidelines:** 
Followed GreenEarth’s brand guidelines for colours and typography. For instance, we adhered to their specified colour palette which included various shades of green, such as #4CAF50 for primary buttons and highlights, and earthy browns like #8B4513 for background elements. 
This created a cohesive and natural aesthetic that aligns with GreenEarth's branding.

For typography, we used "Arial" for body text due to its readability and "Georgia" for headings to convey a classic, professional look. These choices were consistent with GreenEarth's printed materials and other branding assets, ensuring a seamless brand experience across all mediums. 

Additionally, we incorporated high-quality images of their landscaping projects, featuring lush greenery and sustainable designs, to visually reinforce their commitment to a greener planet.

**Assumptions:** 
Users would access the site primarily via mobile devices. Analysis of GreenEarth’s existing site traffic revealed that approximately 70% of visitors were using smartphones or tablets. 

This insight guided our design strategy to prioritise mobile-first design principles. We ensured that all elements, such as navigation menus, buttons, and forms, were optimised for touch interactions and smaller screens. 

For example, we used larger, touch-friendly buttons and simplified navigation to enhance usability on mobile devices. 

Responsive design techniques, like flexible grids and media queries, were employed to ensure that the site layout adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes and orientations. 

This approach not only improved the user experience for mobile visitors but also contributed to better performance and faster loading times, which are critical for mobile users.

**Prototyping:** Created prototypes using Figma.  
**Wireframes:** Developed wireframes to map out the site structure and user flow.

#### Development

**Version Control:** 
Used Git for version control to manage changes and collaborate with the team. We set up a repository on GitHub where each team member could commit their code changes. Branching strategies were used to manage features, fixes, and enhancements. For example, I created a branch named "feature-responsive-design" to work on the mobile responsiveness of the site without affecting the main codebase. Pull requests were reviewed by peers before merging into the main branch, ensuring code quality and consistency.

This is what the structure of the repository looks like:

**Problems and Resolutions:**
Encountered several issues with responsive design during the initial development phase:

1. **Issue with Navbar Layout:** The navigation bar was not collapsing correctly on smaller screens, causing it to overlap with other elements on the page. 
   - **Resolution:** Implemented Bootstrap's built-in navbar component. By adding the appropriate Bootstrap classes, such as `navbar-collapse` and `navbar-toggle`, the navbar now collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile devices, ensuring a clean and user-friendly layout.

2. **Images Not Scaling Properly:** Images on the portfolio page were not scaling correctly, leading to distortion and overflow issues on different screen sizes.
   - **Resolution:** Utilised Bootstrap’s responsive image classes, such as `img-fluid`, to ensure images scale properly within their containers. Additionally, CSS media queries were used to set specific max-width and height properties for different screen sizes.

3. **Form Input Fields:** Form input fields were not adapting to smaller screens, making them difficult to use on mobile devices.
   - **Resolution:** Applied Bootstrap’s grid system to the forms, ensuring input fields stack vertically on smaller screens. Used classes like `col-md-6` and `col-12` to control the layout across various screen sizes.

4. **Text Overlap:** Text blocks in some sections were overlapping with images or other text blocks on smaller screens.
   - **Resolution:** Utilised CSS Flexbox and Bootstrap’s grid layout to create flexible and responsive text containers. Ensured that text reflows appropriately by setting breakpoints for different screen sizes and adjusting padding and margins accordingly.

5. **Footer Layout Issues:** The footer content was not properly aligned on mobile devices, resulting in a disorganized appearance.
   - **Resolution:** Reconstructed the footer using Bootstrap’s grid system. By creating a responsive footer with columns that stack vertically on smaller screens, we ensured that all footer content is accessible and well-organized regardless of the device used.

**Documentation:**
Maintained comprehensive documentation for all code changes and functionalities throughout the project. Each commit in the Git repository included detailed messages explaining the changes made. Additionally, I created a project wiki on GitHub to document the overall structure of the codebase, including descriptions of key components and modules. This documentation also covered setup instructions for the development environment, deployment procedures, and usage guidelines for the CMS. Screenshots and code snippets were included to provide clear examples and facilitate understanding for future developers who might work on the project.
